# FileExpert
This is a software to parse files. It provides a framework to parse and display the file according to your needs.

This version is currently able to parse MP4,ASN.1,DER,PRE(PlayReady Envelope),PRH(PlayReady Header),XMR(PlayReady License File).

It was initially created for the my personal purpose, but I think it could also be very useful for you if you want to parse a file in a specific format. It is easy to to further extend it to support other formats.
